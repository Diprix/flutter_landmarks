![landmarks flutter and swiftui](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*MVIWpODgcf3d5O348l95Fg.png)

A recreation of the [Landmarks sample app](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui) that Apple used to educate developers about SwiftUI. This codebase was created as an educational exercise to help us and other developers learn SwiftUI and have a comparison to a similar app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).
